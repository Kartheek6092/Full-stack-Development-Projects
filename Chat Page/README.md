Here is static we page desing for how a basic chat page looks like.
 In this I've been used HTML, CSS and Bootstarap to build it.

 By creating basic html elements like h1, p and div static structure is defined .
 
 CSS

 Used some stylingns to the html elements and positions in styling and object positions in the page.
 
 Bootstrap

 Bootstrap made the desing easier in this work by using pre defined bootstrap classes in the html document , made it easier.
